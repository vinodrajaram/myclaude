## Priority Matrix

Effort = platform build complexity. Impact = revenue or efficiency impact for users.

| Capability Cluster | User Impact | Build Effort | Phase |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Client Intelligence (Intelligence) | Very High | High | Phase 1 |
| Deal Pipeline (Pipeline) | Very High | Medium | Phase 1 |
| Content Factory (Forge) | Critical | High | Phase 1 |
| Market Intelligence (Signal) | High | Medium | Phase 1 |
| **In-Business Compliance (Compliance)** | **Critical** | **High** | **Phase 1** |
| Credit Risk (Credit) | High | Very High | Phase 2 |
| Workflow & Comms (Connect) | Medium | Medium | Phase 2 |
| Institutional Memory (Memory) | High | High | Phase 2 |
| Resource Intelligence (Talent) | High | Medium | Phase 2 |

**Note on Compliance priority:** Conflict clearance and insider list management are prerequisites for deal origination workflows. An IBC cannot work effectively without this tooling. Phase 1 must include the conflict clearance center, insider list management, and the restricted list / wall crossing controls. The conduct monitoring, policy Q&A, and certification tracker features are Phase 2.

      All modules emit activity events ────────────────►┘
```

**Explanation:**
- **Signal** feeds Intelligence, Pipeline, and Credit with real-time market data
- **Intelligence** informs Pipeline (client relationships → deal opportunities)
- **Pipeline** informs Forge (deal stage → content requirements)
- **Forge** outputs feed into Connect (materials → meeting workflows)
- **Credit** consumes Intelligence (company data) and Pipeline (deal context)
- **Memory** is a universal store — all modules read from and write to Memory
- **Connect** is the workflow layer wrapping all other modules
- **Compliance** sits as a cross-cutting governance layer: reads from all modules, enforces controls (restricted list, Chinese walls) platform-wide
- **Talent** is an observability layer: all modules emit activity events that Talent consumes to infer time entries; Talent feeds back capacity data to Pipeline (for resource planning) and to business heads for strategic analytics

## Phase 1 MVP Scope

For Phase 1 launch, MERIDIAN delivers a connected core across five modules:

1. **Intelligence** — Client 360°, relationship health, meeting briefs
2. **Pipeline** — Deal tracking, pitch status, pipeline analytics + insider list management + conflict check submission
3. **Forge** — Pitch book generation, briefing notes, content drafting
4. **Signal** — Personalized intelligence feed, trigger event monitoring
5. **Compliance** — Conflict clearance center, insider list oversight, wall crossing management, restricted list

The inclusion of Compliance in Phase 1 is non-negotiable: conflict clearance must be in place before deals go into mandate, and the IBC must have tooling from day one. Credit, Connect (full workflow features), and Memory follow in Phase 2.
