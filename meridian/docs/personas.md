# MERIDIAN — User Personas

All personas represent professionals at large financial institutions (bulge bracket, mid-market IB, major corporate banks). Each persona definition includes their role, core job-to-be-done, pain points, and which MERIDIAN modules are most critical to them.

---

## Investment Banking Personas

---

### IB Analyst

**Role:** First-year through third-year analyst. The execution engine of IB.

**Core Job:**
Build the financial models, draft the pitch books, pull the data, run the screens. Analysts spend 70% of their time on tasks that are preparatory — gathering, formatting, synthesizing — before any actual analysis begins.

**Pain Points:**
- Starting pitch books and CIMs from scratch every time
- Hunting across Bloomberg, FactSet, Capital IQ, internal files, and email for the data needed to build a model
- Manual precedent transaction searches that take hours
- Re-doing work because context from prior pitches is lost
- Working across 3–5 live deals simultaneously with no unified tracker
- Missing institutional knowledge that exists only in a colleague's head or buried in old emails

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Forge** (primary) — auto-draft pitch books, CIMs, financial analyses
- **Meridian Memory** (primary) — precedent search, past transaction comps, knowledge retrieval
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client background, company profiles
- **Meridian Pipeline** — deal status, what to prioritize

**Secondary Modules:** Signal (market data for models), Connect (task tracking)

---

### IB Associate

**Role:** Post-MBA or promoted analyst (years 3–5). Manages analysts, owns deliverable quality, begins client interaction.

**Core Job:**
Own the quality and logic of all deal materials. Manage day-to-day analyst workflow, review models and decks, begin building client relationships. Increasingly strategic but still deeply execution-oriented.

**Pain Points:**
- Reviewing analyst work is manual and time-consuming — no AI-assisted QC
- Context-switching across multiple live deals with no single view
- Client communications happen across email, calls, and WhatsApp with no structured log
- Hard to track what's been pitched vs. what's in mandate vs. what's lost
- Onboarding onto a new coverage sector takes weeks of manual research

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Forge** — review and refine AI-drafted materials
- **Meridian Pipeline** — deal tracking, mandate management
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client and company deep dives
- **Meridian Connect** — task management, meeting coordination

**Secondary Modules:** Signal, Memory

---

### VP / Director

**Role:** Deal leader, client relationship co-owner, origination contributor.

**Core Job:**
Drive deals from origination to execution. Own client relationships alongside the MD. Pitch new ideas, manage the process, keep deals moving. Heavy meeting load with pre- and post-meeting work that is currently unstructured and manually intensive.

**Pain Points:**
- Meeting prep takes 1–2 hours per client meeting — briefing notes, news, portfolio review
- No structured way to track client "health" — relationship engagement, recency of touch, open items
- Ideas pitched to clients are not systematically tracked; follow-up falls through the cracks
- Market intelligence is scattered — no consolidated feed of relevant news and events
- Hard to demonstrate coverage value to the MD without data on activity and impact

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client 360°, relationship health, meeting prep
- **Meridian Pipeline** — pitch tracking, deal origination, mandate conversion
- **Meridian Signal** — market intelligence, trigger events, competitive landscape
- **Meridian Connect** — meeting prep briefs, follow-up tracking, CRM sync

**Secondary Modules:** Forge, Memory

---

### Managing Director

**Role:** Senior coverage or product banker. P&L owner for coverage group or product. Primary client relationship holder.

**Core Job:**
Own the franchise. Generate mandates. Develop and deepen senior client relationships. Strategic conversations, not execution. Needs fast, sharp, synthesis — not raw data.

**Pain Points:**
- Preparing for a CEO/CFO meeting requires synthesis from 10 different sources
- No clear view of total relationship economics across a client (all fees, all products, all deals)
- Hard to know which clients are "at risk" without explicit CRM hygiene from their teams
- Content factory (pitch books) takes too long — by the time a deck is ready, the moment has passed
- Competitive intelligence is informal — relying on what they heard at a conference

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Intelligence** — executive-level client briefings, relationship economics, pipeline health
- **Meridian Signal** — M&A triggers, sector events, credit events for strategic clients
- **Meridian Pipeline** — mandate pipeline, revenue dashboard, league table positioning
- **Meridian Forge** — executive summary quality materials, fast-turnaround thought leadership

**Secondary Modules:** Connect (meeting scheduling and CRM), Memory

---

### Coverage Banker

**Role:** Sector or geography-focused banker who owns a client portfolio across products.

**Core Job:**
Be the trusted advisor to a portfolio of clients. Stay close to their strategic agenda, financial situation, and capital markets needs. Coordinate product delivery across IB, DCM, ECM, M&A. Manage a coverage territory.

**Pain Points:**
- Monitoring 30–50 clients simultaneously is overwhelming without systematic tools
- Product coordination (cross-selling IB, DCM, leverage) requires manual communication
- Client portfolio financials go stale quickly — hard to track earnings, guidance changes, capital structure moves
- White space analysis (which clients haven't used which products) is done in Excel, not a tool
- CRM is a compliance burden, not a productivity tool

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Intelligence** — portfolio-level client monitoring, white space analysis
- **Meridian Pipeline** — cross-product pipeline, revenue attribution
- **Meridian Signal** — client-specific and sector event monitoring
- **Meridian Connect** — CRM logging, coverage coordination, cross-product workflow

**Secondary Modules:** Forge (quick pitches), Credit (for leveraged clients)

---

### Product Banker

**Role:** Specialist in one product (M&A, ECM, DCM, LevFin, etc.). Pitches and executes within that product silo.

**Core Job:**
Be the best product specialist in the room. Generate ideas for their product across the coverage banker's client portfolio. Support execution once mandate is awarded. Stay at the cutting edge of market conditions for their product.

**Pain Points:**
- Staying current on market conditions (spreads, comparable transactions, market windows) takes constant effort
- Transaction comparables are time-consuming to compile and format
- Generating new product ideas for client portfolios requires cross-referencing client financials with market conditions
- Execution support (documentation, compliance, syndication tracking) is fragmented

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Signal** — product-specific market intelligence, transaction comps, market windows
- **Meridian Forge** — product-specific pitch materials, term sheets, transaction summaries
- **Meridian Memory** — precedent transaction database, product-specific knowledge vault

## Corporate Banking Personas

---

### Relationship Manager (RM)

**Role:** The coverage banker equivalent in corporate banking. Owns client relationships, drives product cross-sell.

**Core Job:**
Manage a portfolio of corporate clients, develop relationships with CFOs and Treasurers, identify lending and fee opportunities, coordinate product delivery across cash management, FX, trade finance, and credit.

**Pain Points:**
- Client monitoring is reactive — RMs learn about client issues from the news, not from their own systems
- Annual review cycles are labour-intensive with no automation
- Cross-product coordination is done via email chains — no structured workflow
- Credit appetite signals from credit officers come too slowly, delaying relationship conversations
- Revenue attribution across products is opaque — hard to demonstrate wallet share

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client 360°, annual review automation, relationship health
- **Meridian Pipeline** — product cross-sell pipeline, opportunity tracking
- **Meridian Connect** — client communication logging, annual review workflow

---

**Role:** Underwrites credit for the RM's client portfolio. Prepares credit applications and annual reviews.

**Core Job:**
Analyse the creditworthiness of borrowers. Write credit applications, annual reviews, and waivers. Model financial projections and stress scenarios. Maintain portfolio risk quality.

**Pain Points:**
- Credit memos are written from scratch every time — no template population from existing data
- Financial spreading (entering client financials into the credit model) is 4–6 hours of manual work per company
- Covenant monitoring is done manually in spreadsheets — breaches can be missed
- Comparables and benchmarks for industry credit metrics are hard to find quickly
- Information required is scattered across Bloomberg, internal systems, client-provided docs

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Credit** (primary) — AI-assisted credit memo drafting, financial spreading, covenant monitoring
- **Meridian Memory** — prior credit history, industry benchmarks, precedent waivers
- **Meridian Intelligence** — company financial data, management profiles, news synthesis

Ensure the bank's credit portfolio meets risk appetite. Challenge credit proposals. Identify portfolio concentration risk. Escalate early-warning signals. Provide credit appetite guidance to RMs and Analysts.

**Pain Points:**
- Credit packages arrive in varying formats and quality — no standardization
- Early warning indicators are tracked manually across spreadsheets
- No consolidated view of portfolio risk across the book (sector concentrations, covenant breach rates)
- Covenant monitoring is reactive — they learn of breaches after the fact
- Decision turnaround pressure means thorough challenge is sacrificed for speed

**Primary Modules:**

- **Meridian Intelligence** — real-time company and sector data during credit review

**Role:** Specialist in trade finance, cash management, FX, structured products, or other corporate banking products.

**Core Job:**
Design and pitch product solutions to corporate clients. Work with RMs to identify product opportunities. Support execution and ongoing client service for their product.

**Pain Points:**
- Product analytics (utilization, revenue, market share) are scattered across multiple back-office systems
- Proposals are manually prepared every time — no auto-population from client data
- Market pricing and competitor benchmarking for products is informal
- Cross-sell coordination with RMs is ad hoc

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Pipeline** — product utilization, cross-sell opportunity tracking
- **Meridian Forge** — product proposals, term sheets, client presentations
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client financial profile, product appetite analysis
- **Meridian Connect** — RM coordination, client communication

## Shared / Cross-Cutting Personas

---

### Business Head (Coverage or Product)

**Role:** Head of a coverage or product group. P&L responsibility for the franchise.

**Core Job:**
Drive revenue. Manage the team. Set coverage and product strategy. Interface with senior clients and senior management. Manage banker performance and allocation.

**Pain Points:**
- No consolidated view of coverage revenue, pipeline value, and banker activity
- Team performance is assessed informally — no data-driven framework
- Strategic opportunities (M&A wave, DCM window, credit cycle) are identified reactively
- Board and management presentations require significant preparation

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Pipeline** — franchise pipeline, revenue, league table
- **Meridian Intelligence** — key relationship portfolio, strategic client health
- **Meridian Signal** — macro/sector signals, competitive intelligence
- **Meridian Forge** — management presentations, board materials

---

### In-Business Compliance Officer (IBC)

**Role:** Embedded compliance professional sitting within a specific business line (IB, Corporate Banking, Markets). The first line of defence — not the formal Compliance department, but the compliance function living inside the business.

Also called: Business Compliance Officer, Line 1 Compliance, Front Office Compliance, BCO.

**Core Job:**
Own the day-to-day compliance posture of the business line. Manage conflict clearance for all new deals and mandates. Provide real-time policy guidance to bankers. Monitor active deal pipeline for conduct and regulatory risk. Act as the bridge between the front office and formal Compliance (Line 2). Ensure insider lists are correctly maintained, wall crossings are properly executed, and conflict decisions are documented.

**Distinction from Risk & Compliance Officer:**
The Risk & Compliance Officer is a Line 2 oversight function — they audit and govern. The IBC is embedded in the business as Line 1 — they are a daily participant in deal workflows, not a periodic reviewer. IBCs often have prior banking experience and speak the same language as the deal teams.

**Pain Points:**
- Conflict checks are currently manual questionnaires — bankers self-declare, IBCs cross-check in spreadsheets and email — the process misses latent conflicts
- No single view of all live mandates and advisory relationships to run a conflict search against
- Insider list maintenance is done in Excel — high error risk, manually updated
- Wall crossing approvals are email-based with no structured tracking
- No real-time view of which deals in the pipeline have unresolved compliance conditions
- When a complex deal involves multiple parties and products, mapping all potential conflicts is time-consuming and error-prone
- Regulatory changes require manually briefing the front office — no structured communication channel

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Connect** (primary) — conflict clearance workflow, wall crossing management, compliance dashboard, approval queues
- **Meridian Pipeline** — full pipeline visibility to monitor mandates and advisory relationships for conflicts, insider list oversight
- **Meridian Intelligence** — client relationship landscape to contextualise conflict risk
- **Meridian Memory** — past conflict decisions, policy documents, regulatory guidance search

**Secondary Modules:** Security-level: restricted list management, audit trail access across all modules

---

### Risk & Compliance Officer

**Role:** Formal Compliance department. Line 2 oversight function with bank-wide regulatory accountability.

**Core Job:**
Monitor for MNPI handling, Chinese wall integrity, KYC/AML compliance, data governance, and conduct risk. Provide audit trail for regulatory examinations. Set policy that IBCs implement.

**Pain Points:**
- No automated MNPI flagging when a banker accesses a restricted company's data
- Chinese wall enforcement is manual and process-dependent
- Audit trails for client data access and communication logs are incomplete
- Regulatory change management is reactive

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Connect** — compliance audit trails, communication logs, conflict decision history
- **Meridian Memory** — restricted list management, MNPI wall crossings, policy library
- System-level: All modules include role-based access, data classification, and audit logging

---

### Operations / Middle Office

**Role:** Executes deal operations, settlement, and reporting. Supports front-office workflow.

**Core Job:**
Ensure deal execution runs smoothly. Manage regulatory reporting, KYC processes, and operational risk. Act as the interface between front office and back office.

**Pain Points:**
- Coordinating with front office on deal status requires constant interruption
- KYC and onboarding processes are manual and slow
- Regulatory reporting requires data extraction from multiple systems

**Primary Modules:**
- **Meridian Connect** — workflow coordination, deal status visibility
- **Meridian Pipeline** — deal execution status
- **Meridian Memory** — KYC documentation, onboarding history
